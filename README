BUILDING & REFERENCES:
This project will not build on your computer unless you have a copy of HonorBuddy of the appropriate version 
(usually the above version or newer). Furthermore, you will have to update the reference for the project to 
point to the correct executable and library (where ever they may be on your machine).

If I get permission to add the executable and dll needed to ensure a steady reference for the project, I will
add one.  However, until that time, do not worry about overwriting the reference and commiting.  It must be
done.
