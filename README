!!! IMPORTANT !!!
BUILDING & REFERENCES:
Please follow the instructions below to work on this solution.  The exe and dll file are marked as excluded via the
.gitignore file in References folder.  This will be the case until I obtain permission to include those two files
in the repo. This way, you can keep those two files there and not worry about having to change the references every
time you do a pull.

1. Download the above version of Honorbuddy.
2. Copy Honorbuddy.exe and Tripper.Tools.dll to the References folder.
3. Write your code.
